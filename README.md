# CMD LC-1 Ableton 9 Control surface script
A port of the original Behringer control surface script to Ableton 9.1.4+.
Please report any bug using in the issue section.

# Installation notes
Read this if you have troubles making it run. Please close Ableton before following this procedure.

- Download the latest script from [here](https://github.com/mpiraux/CMD-LC-1-Ableton-9-Control-Surface-Script/archive/master.zip).
- Go to Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory. [Here](https://www.ableton.com/en/help/article/install-third-party-remote-script/) is how to find it: 
- Create an empty directory named `CMD_LC1`, avoid using space or `-`. Ableton is pretty sensitive to directory names so I recommend you to use mine.
- Extract the downloaded zip, and copy all the `.py` files inside into the directory you've created.
- Start Ableton, you should be able to select the script appearing in the control surface list with the name of the directory previously created.

If this is not working, please fill in an [issue](https://github.com/mpiraux/CMD-LC-1-Ableton-9-Control-Surface-Script/issues) and provide your [Log.txt file](http://support.liine.net/customer/portal/articles/1339939-where-is-log-txt-) along with the description of you problem.
